### Repository Workflow Guidelines

To maintain an organized workflow within our repository, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Branch Management**: Always work out of the `develop` branch.

- **Handling Questions and Discussions**:
  - If you have any questions or need to discuss a topic, please tag me in the relevant issue.
  - If there is no related issue, feel free to create a new one.

- **Pull Requests (PRs)**:
  - Do not merge changes directly to the `develop` branch. Instead, create a PR.
  - Assign your team members as reviewers for your PR to ensure quality and collaborative improvements.

- **Issue Management**:
  - Assign yourself to an issue by marking yourself as the `Assignee`.
  - Utilize our **PRIMES Manuscript Progress** Project board to manage and track tasks:
    - Add new issues to the **TODO** card.
    - Move issues to the **In Progress** or **Done** card as you progress.
    - Adjust the timeline if needed, ensuring to communicate these changes with the team.
