    "Thyroid cancer is among the most prevalent endocrine malignancies worldwide, with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) representing the majority of cases \\[@pellegriti2013\\]. The management and prognosis of thyroid cancer critically depend on the timely and accurate prediction of cancer recurrence. Traditional approaches, primarily based on clinical and pathological parameters, often lack the precision required for personalized treatment planning \\[@bhattacharya2023\\]. With advancements in machine learning (ML) techniques, there’s a burgeoning interest in leveraging these analytical tools to enhance the predictive accuracy regarding cancer recurrence, thereby improving the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and follow-up strategies \\[@bhattacharya2023, @xi2022\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "This paper explores the application of six distinct machine learning algorithms—Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and the ensemble learning methods – Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) — to predict cancer recurrence in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer. Utilizing the differentiated thyroid cancer recurrence dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository \\[@borzooei2023\\], this study aims to compare the predictive performance of these algorithms in a clinical setting. The dataset comprises patient demographic information, clinical features, and pathological details, providing a solid foundation for predictive modeling.\n",

    "ANNs, celebrated for their capability to model complex nonlinear relationships through interconnected processing elements, offer powerful tools for medical prediction tasks \\[@abiodun2018\\]. SVMs, recognized for their effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces and versatility in handling both linear and nonlinear data, present a robust methodology for classification challenges \\[@cervantes2020\\]. KNN, a straightforward yet efficient algorithm based on feature space proximity, offers an intuitive approach to classification by leveraging the similarity between cases \\[@syriopoulos2022\\]. LR, known for its simplicity and efficient training, offers a intuitive way for determining the decision boundary between linearly separable data points, and directly outputs the predicted probabilities for each class \\[@maalouf2011\\]. RF, an ensemble learning method that uses bagging on classification trees, proves to be efficient and accurate in handling high-dimensional and non-linear data \\[@genuer2010\\]. XGBoost, an ensemble learning method that uses boosting (meaning that the algorithm sequentially generates new trees based on previous training output), is very fast and robust for a variety of tasks \\[@anju2018\\].\n",

    "By applying all six machine learning approaches to the differentiated thyroid cancer recurrence dataset, this study seeks to identify the most effective model for predicting cancer recurrence, thus contributing to the ongoing efforts to enhance patient outcomes in thyroid cancer management.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a rigorous evaluation of model performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity, this paper aims to shed light on the strengths and limitations of each algorithm in the context of thyroid cancer recurrence prediction. Furthermore, the study discusses the implications of these findings for clinical practice, emphasizing the potential of machine learning to revolutionize cancer care by enabling more accurate and personalized risk assessments \\[@konstantina2015\\]"
